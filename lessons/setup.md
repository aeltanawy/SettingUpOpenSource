## Objectives

- Choose a license for the project
- Create a new repository on GitHub
- Initialize the project with some templates
- Clone the new repository locally

**Duration: 30 minutes**

### GitHub Repositories

- Host source code
- Provide issues for tracking...anything
- Pull Requests for simplified collaborative development
- Pull Requests also provide a launch point for doing checks on code before committing

### Open Source: Choosing a license

- Need a license to clearly state what permissions you are giving others
- Permissive (BSD, etc.) vs. Copy-left (GPL, etc.)
- Scientific Python community tends to use BSD

### Create a bare repository with .gitignore, Readme, and a license

- Click "New Repository" button
- Choose name, add description
- Initialize with README
- Select license
- Choose a `.gitignore` for Python
- This provides a ready-to-go skeleton for a new project
- Click "Create Repository"

### Clone the repository locally

- Use git to clone repository locally
    - `git clone https://github.com/myuser/myrepo`
    - `git clone git@github.com:myuser/myrepo`
