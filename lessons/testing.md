# Testing

## Objectives
* Setup our sample project for testing
* Discuss types of tests
* Write tests using PyTest
* Run the test suite
* Practice test driven development
* Check the test coverage of our project

**Duration: 60 minutes**

Testing is the only way to keep your code base maintained on multiple versions
of Python, ensure its accuracy against known cases, and prevent regressions. In
this lesson, we'll go over the basics to testing, setup a test suit on our
project, run it locally, and then run it on TravisCI. Finally, we'll check the
test coverage on our project.

### Add (canned) library code to repository

### Writing tests with PyTest

### Running tests

### Coverage with coverage.py and pytest-cov
