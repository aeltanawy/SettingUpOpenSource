# Setting Up Open Source Projects

Setting up an open source project with an advanced set of tools is easier than
ever. However, the breadth and complexity of the tools available can be
intimidating to the new user. In this half-day, intermediate level tutorial, we
will interactively walk through the steps needed to set up an open source
project on GitHub in the most sustainable fashion possible. Topics discussed and
covered in a hands-on fashion include: creating a new repository on GitHub;
testing with PyTest; continuous integration with TravisCI; and online
documentation with Sphinx and ReadTheDocs. The goal of the tutorial is to get
attendees over the initial hump of learning these tools and communicate some
best practices from the world of open source.
